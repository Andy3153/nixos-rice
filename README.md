# nixos-rice
These are all the NixOS configurations and custom modules that I use on a daily basis.

## A warning
Feel free to try and use this, but at this point it isn't really meant for other people to use for reasons like the fact that I directly point to impure files on my filesystem for crucial program configuration files that you'd manually have to git clone into your filesystem.

## My custom modules
I wrote custom modules for everything my system needs to do, I barely need to use normal Nix configuration options. Feel free to check them out.
